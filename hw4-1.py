# -----------------
# User Instructions
# 
# In this problem you will be refactoring the bsuccessors function.
# Your new function, bsuccessors3, will take a state as an input
# and return a dict of {state:action} pairs. 
#
# A state is a (here, there, light) tuple. Here and there are 
# frozensets of people (each person is represented by an integer
# which corresponds to their travel time), and light is 0 if 
# it is on the `here` side and 1 if it is on the `there` side.
#
# An action is a tuple of (travelers, arrow), where the arrow is
# '->' or '<-'. See the test() function below for some examples
# of what your function's input and output should look like.
